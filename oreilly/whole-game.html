<h1><span id="sec-whole-game-intro" class="quarto-section-identifier">Whole game</span></h1><p>Our goal in this part of the book is to give you a rapid overview of the main tools of data science: <strong>importing</strong>, <strong>tidying</strong>, <strong>transforming</strong>, and <strong>visualizing data</strong>, as shown in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?fig-ds-whole-game</span>. We want to show you the “whole game” of data science giving you just enough of all the major pieces so that you can tackle real, if simple, datasets. The later parts of the book will hit each of these topics in more depth, increasing the range of data science challenges that you can tackle.</p></div>
