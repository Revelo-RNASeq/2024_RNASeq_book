</header><p>Il volcano plot è una rappresentazione grafica molto utile nell’analisi dell’espressione differenziale, in quanto permette di visualizzare in modo immediato i geni più significativi e con i maggiori cambiamenti di espressione.</p>
<p><strong>Come funziona:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Asse x:</strong> Log2 fold change. Rappresenta la differenza di espressione tra due condizioni, espressa in scala logaritmica in base 2. Un valore positivo indica che il gene è sovraespresso nella condizione in esame rispetto alla condizione di riferimento, mentre un valore negativo indica che il gene è sottoespresso.</li>
<li>
<strong>Asse y:</strong> -log10(p-value aggiustato). Rappresenta il valore negativo del logaritmo in base 10 del p-value aggiustato per test multipli. Un valore più alto sull’asse y indica una maggiore significatività statistica.</li>
<li>
<strong>Punti:</strong> Ogni punto rappresenta un gene. La sua posizione sul grafico indica il suo log2 fold change e la sua significatività statistica.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretazione:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Geni in alto a destra e in alto a sinistra:</strong> Questi geni sono i più interessanti, in quanto mostrano sia un log2 fold change elevato (in valore assoluto) che una significatività statistica elevata. Sono i geni più fortemente sovraespressi o sottoespressi.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geni vicini all’asse y:</strong> Questi geni hanno un log2 fold change vicino a zero, quindi non mostrano una grande differenza di espressione tra le condizioni.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geni vicini all’asse x:</strong> Questi geni hanno un p-value aggiustato elevato, quindi non sono considerati significativamente differenzialmente espressi.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vantaggi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Visione d’insieme:</strong> Il volcano plot fornisce una visione d’insieme dei risultati dell’analisi differenziale, permettendo di identificare rapidamente i geni più interessanti.</li>
<li>
<strong>Identificazione dei geni significativi:</strong> I geni significativamente differenzialmente espressi sono chiaramente evidenziati nel grafico.</li>
<li>
<strong>Valutazione del fold change:</strong> Il grafico permette di valutare l’entità del cambiamento di espressione per ciascun gene.</li>
</ul>
